## Feature Request

### Original Request

Create two pages for Twilio A2P 10DLC campaign registration for a personal AI assistant called "PRouz":

1. `/privacy` — Privacy Policy for PRouz SMS service
2. `/terms` — Terms and Conditions for PRouz Assistant

Both must match existing site style, be clean and professional, and be publicly accessible.

### Clarified Requirements

- Pages are for Twilio A2P 10DLC compliance, not for the website itself
- PRouz is a personal AI assistant; only Pouria's phone number receives messages
- No user data collection, sharing, or selling
- Messages: task reminders, schedule notifications, informational alerts
- Contact method: link to /contact page
- Effective date: 2026-02-15
- Terms must include bold HELP and STOP instructions
- Opt-out: Reply STOP; Help: Reply HELP

### Out of Scope

- Navbar links to these pages (they're legal/compliance pages, not primary nav)
- Dynamic content or data fetching

## Context

### Related Existing Features

- `/about` page — similar static content page, uses `prose` classes
- `/contact` page — referenced as contact method

### Key Files

- `src/app/about/page.tsx` — pattern for static content pages
- `src/app/layout.tsx` — root layout (Navbar + Footer wrapping)
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — needs new routes added

### Architecture

Server components with static metadata export, following the About page pattern. `prose prose-lg dark:prose-invert` for readable text. Update sitemap with both routes.

## Progress Log

### 2026-02-15 - Implementation

- Created RFD
- Explored codebase patterns (About, Contact, Layout)
- Implemented both pages + sitemap update
- Build verified — both routes render as static pages
- Code reviewed — clean, follows existing conventions

### Files Changed

- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` — New privacy policy page
- `src/app/terms/page.tsx` — New terms and conditions page
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` — Added /privacy and /terms routes
